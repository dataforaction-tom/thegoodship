## Backend (Cloudflare Pages Functions + D1)

| Endpoint | File | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| `GET /feed` | `functions/feed.js` | Proxies tomcw.xyz RSS |
| `POST /api/sponsor-webhook` | `functions/api/sponsor-webhook.js` | Drift sponsorship webhook → `sponsors` |
| `GET /api/ledger` | `functions/api/ledger.js` | Public ledger JSON (CORS open) |
| `GET /api/captures` | `functions/api/captures.js` | Token-gated debug read of `raw_captures` |
| `POST /api/subscribe` | `functions/api/subscribe.js` | Newsletter signup → `subscribers` |
| `GET /api/subscribers` | `functions/api/subscribers.js` | Token-gated CSV/JSON export of `subscribers` |

- **D1 database:** `good-ship-ledger`, bound as `DB` (Production).
- **Shared parser:** `lib/parse-submission.mjs` (pure, unit-tested in `test/`).
- **Schema:** `schema.sql` (fresh installs); `migrations/000N_*.sql` (applied incrementally).
- **Tables:** `sponsors`, `raw_captures`, `subscribers`.
- **Env vars (Pages, Production):** `DB` binding, `WEBHOOK_TOKEN`, `DEBUG_TOKEN`.

## Drift configuration

- Sponsor form `formId: ptwFhkl5iFu63BRFj0H2F` ("Supporting open resources"), embedded as `supporting-open-resources-PTNp3v`.
- Webhook → `POST https://good-ship.co.uk/api/sponsor-webhook`, with custom header `X-Webhook-Token` matching `WEBHOOK_TOKEN`.
- Webhook payload includes a `payment` object (`status`, `amount` in minor units, `currency`, `stripePaymentIntentId`) — added so the ledger has a trustworthy amount.
